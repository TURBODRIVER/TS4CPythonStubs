# TS4CPythonStubs

The Sims 4 CPython Stubs auto-generated from CPython files for research, autocompletion, and type hinting purposes. **This is not The Sims 4 source code**.

Current State & Goals:
- Stubs cover all of the CPython code but lack proper arguments naming and type hinting. Most of that can be inferred from the Python code interacting with CPython modules.
- Stubs are missing imports for types outside of typing module.
- Documentation contains incorrect/outdated information, some functions need manual signature corrections.
